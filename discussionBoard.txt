1. https://github.com/github/gitignore
- This is the required repo. I find it interesting that github has a built in file that allows you to decide 
what you dont want to push to your repository and they also have multiple ways of implementing it with this repo.

2. https://github.com/vuejs/vue
I find this repo intersting because I have web development experience and have often struggled with the UI aspect of 
web development and this project is specifically built for UI so I may use this in the future.

3. https://github.com/flutter/flutter
As someone with web development experience I find flutter to be useful in that it builds fast and pleasant looking user 
experiences for mobile web and desktop so it takes away some of the work id have to do normally when thinking about how an 
application of mine will look on different devices.

4. https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco
Since im pursuing game development its important for me to be aware of and learn the physics in games and this project is based 
around that and has a plugin for Unity. It also aims to help research and develop robotics and machine learning which are other 
things I have interest in.

5. https://github.com/oguzeroglu/Ego
Ego is a decision making library for AI. I have no experience when it comes to AI but this project is in a familiar language and
AI is something I would like to implement into future projects so I believe this will be a good source to look back on.
